I'm a software engineer living in Nashville, TN, and I'm working toward building the future of cloud marketplaces with the awesome people at tackle.io. I've worked on a variety of projects in the startup space, and I'm really passionate about building great user and developer experiences.

I believe in pragmatism, kindness, and continuous learning.

I've always been captivated by DIY cultures around creativity and rebellion like skating, punk rock, and some hip-hop (not a whole lot of what's popular today..üë¥üèª). In a way, a lot of that interest drove me to build software. Software provides a place for me to channel that same type of energy into building a better way to do things.
